What is WTForms?
================

WTForms is a flexible forms validation and rendering library for python web development.

To get started using WTForms, we recommend reading the crash course on the website: http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/.

If you downloaded the package from PyPI, there will be a prebuilt copy of the html documentation in the `docs/html/` directory.

You can also manually generate the documentation by running `make html` in the docs directory.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install WTForms is using pip:

    pip install WTForms

If you downloaded a source tarball, or cloned the repository, you can install using setup.py:

    python setup.py install

You can also simply place the `wtforms` subdirectory somewhere on your python path. This can be useful if you deploy on Google App Engine for example.
